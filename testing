You create an Application Auto Scaling policy for your DynamoDB table.

DynamoDB publishes consumed capacity metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.

If the table's consumed capacity exceeds your target utilization (or falls below the target) for a specific length of time, Amazon CloudWatch triggers an alarm. You can view the alarm on the console and receive notifications using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

The CloudWatch alarm invokes Application Auto Scaling to evaluate your scaling policy.

Application Auto Scaling issues an UpdateTable request to adjust your table's provisioned throughput.

DynamoDB processes the UpdateTable request, dynamically increasing (or decreasing) the table's provisioned throughput capacity so that it approaches your target utilizatio
